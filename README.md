MovieLens Recommendations
=============================================
**Final Project for TCDS - Technion Data Science Specialization**, Dean Shabi, Dedi Kovatch, July 2019

In this project, we used Funk-SVD model to predict best movies for users, based on 20M user ratings in **MovieLens** Dataset.
The dataset includes 20M ratings on 27K movies (from early 20's century to 2016) of 138K users.
